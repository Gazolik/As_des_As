# As_des_As
###### Rules:
As des As is a logic Prolog program of a plane fight with multiple IA.
Each turn the two players will choose 3 actions to execute, at the same time. 
During each move, if a plane is able to shoot the other one, it does and take off one life point of its opponent.
A player win, when the other player's life has reached 0.

Beware! if a player is out of the board at the end of the 3 moves, he looses the game.

### IA:
We provide many IA with different behaviour such as:
- Random.
- Offensive.
- Defensive.
- Hybrid

### Human Player:
In order to make this program, as ludic as possible, we provide the possibility to switch between an IA and a Human player, to challenge each IA.

### IHM:
We have developed a light web interface to show the fight result between 2 IA or to take part of the battle!
